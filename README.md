# Effector-Gene-Feature-Table-Using-R
This is taking a protein FASTA file as an input the last 20 proteins from effector protein sequences and counts the amount of "d","e","f","i","l","s","t","v" that appear in the sequence. Then it takes each of those vectors and arranges it in a matrix with each sample labeling the frequency of the proteins of interest.
